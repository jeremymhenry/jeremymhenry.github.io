			  <h1>Report on “Pattern Based Cache Coherency Architecture for Embedded Manycores”</h1>
			  <p>(introduction)
            This paper delves into the topic of managing memory access patterns in embedded systems in order to improve performance and decrease power consumption. Manycore processors are specialist multi-core processors which contain simpler, independent processor cores design 
            for parallel processing. Improving a processor’s performance, but also not increasing power consumption is to increase the number of cores on the chip. However, only a handful of programming models can (handle) manycores, and one of them, OpenMP, allows memory to be 
            shared within a consistent state between cores. This memory coherence is an issue for embedded systems due to time issues in real-time applications and increased power consumption. The authors’ solution to this was to implement a hardware/software solution to optimize 
             cache coherence protocol.
