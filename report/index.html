				<h1>Report on “Pattern Based Cache Coherency Architecture for Embedded Manycores”</h1>
				<p>This paper delves into the topic of managing memory access patterns in embedded systems in order to improve performance and decrease power consumption. Manycore processors are specialist multi-core processors which contain simpler, independent processor cores design for parallel processing. Improving a processor’s performance, but also not increasing power consumption is to increase the number of cores on the chip. This memory coherence is an issue for embedded systems due to time issues in real-time applications and increased power consumption.  </p>
				<p>The authors’ solution to this was to implement a hardware/software solution to optimize cache coherence protocol. The authors’ approach was to use an architecture slightly above a Chip Multiprocessing Architecture to set up a shared memory model on a manycore with the intention of improving speed and performance for video and signal processing applications. The architecture the authors engineered was called Co-Design Cache Coherent Architecture (CoCCA) - a coherency hybrid based on Chip MultiProcessing (CMP) architecture - which has the following properties: Integrated Part to manage memory access patterns and store addresses in the form of table patterns, and models of transaction messages and read/write properties.</p>
				<p>For their research, they used applications such as SteamIt benchmark suite, SDF benchmark suite, and an in-house application using a Laplacian filter, and for each of these applications, extracted millions of accesses to shared memory and generated patterns, and each showed normal behavior in terms of accesses to shared memory. For the majority of cases, a low number of 1D patterns (defined as (base, address, size, stride)) was enough for representing the majority of the shared-memory accesses, but extracting 2D patterns helps in reducing the required number of entries. For streaming embedded applications, there can be a mix of 1D and 2D patterns and is relevant to the majority of usual cases. Thus, for normal streaming applications, their prefetch pattern-based coherence protocol represented the majority of cases, enhancing execution performance and speed.</p>
				<p>Using the modification of the CMP architecture, CoCCA, the authors were able discover some significant advantages relating to manycores for embedded systems. Using a low number of patterns accounts for most, and at times, all of the shared memory access, which allows for up to 20% improvement in performance in most machines and up to 70% improvement for memory bound programs, which in turn, allows for a decrease in power consumption and overall better execution. </p>
